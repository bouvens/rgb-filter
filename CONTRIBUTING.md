## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= v4 must be installed.

## Installation

- Running `yarn install` in the app's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Development Server

- `yarn start` will run the app's development server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000) by default with hot module reloading.

## Building

- `yarn run build` creates a production build by default in the dist directory.

   To create a development build, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development` while running this command.
